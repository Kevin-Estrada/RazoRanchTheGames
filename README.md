# RazoRanchTheGames

Steps for setting up

1. Install mkdocs using (pip install mkdocs)
2. Install mkdocs-material using (pip install mkdocs-material) since this theme used is for matrial, not the default mkdocs theme
3. Run the test server using (mkdocs serve)
4. Once done developing, use (mkdocs build) to build the pages.
